# Working on cstack

This repo holds Chris-Jay's agent skills. `bin/cstack` symlinks them into Claude Code and Codex
on every machine, so a change here reaches every harness on the next `cstack update`. Read
[README.md](README.md) for what the skills do.

## Skill conventions

- One folder per skill: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, kebab-case, with the folder name equal to the
  frontmatter `name`. Detail that is needed only at one step goes in its own file in the folder,
  linked from SKILL.md. Scripts go in `scripts/`.
- The `description` says only when to use the skill, in one short sentence with the trigger
  phrase, for example: Use when the user's message starts with or mentions "cstack-build".
  What the skill does goes in the body.
- Skills refer to each other by relative path (`../cstack-break/SKILL.md`). That works because
  every skill is linked into the same folder.
- Every skill must work in Claude Code and Codex, inside and outside T3 Code. When a step uses a
  T3 tool, give the fallback in the same place.
- Shared state goes in the record files described in `skills/cstack-break/record.md`, never in
  the conversation alone.
- Model names live only in `skills/cstack-break/config.md`.
- Write for an agent reading cold: short instructions, the reason when it is not obvious, no
  history of how a rule came about.

## Adapted material

`upstream.tsv` lists what was adapted from tstack, with the commit it came from.
`bin/cstack upstream` shows what changed upstream since. When you take upstream changes, update
the commit in `upstream.tsv`.

## Changing the installer

`bin/cstack` runs on Debian (`hub`) and stock macOS, so keep it to bash 3.2: no associative
arrays, no `mapfile`, no `readlink -f`. It must never replace a file it did not create. After a
change, run `bin/cstack install` twice (the second run should print only the summary line) and
`bin/cstack status`.

## Machines

How each machine is set up is in the fleet repo (`github.com/CM9ine/fleet`). When the install
steps change, update its `standard-box.md` and host files too.
