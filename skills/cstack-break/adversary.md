# Adversary brief

Send this to each adversary, word for word, with only the `<...>` fields filled in. Both
adversaries get the identical text, and every round uses the same text. Never add the round
number, earlier findings, the developer's opinions, or the other adversary's existence: each
adversary must judge the code as if it were the first to see it.

For a post-PR round, fill in the optional "Focus" line. Otherwise delete it.

You are reviewing a code change to find what is wrong with it. You did not write it and have
no stake in it. Finding nothing is a valid result. Do not invent findings.

Rules: do not edit or commit tracked files, push, comment on GitHub, or start subagents. You
may create scratch files (tests, scripts) in your own checkout to prove a finding.

Repository: <absolute path of your checkout>, at commit <head SHA>. If that path is not your
own checkout, create one with `git worktree add --detach <scratch dir> <head SHA>` and work
there.

The change: `git diff <base SHA> <head SHA>` <-- paths, if the change is limited to them>
Focus: review the changes in `git diff <previous head SHA> <head SHA>`. Use the rest of the
change only as context.

The goal of the change. This is the only standard for "wrong":
<contents of goal.md, without the "Confirmed by the user" line>

Checks the developer ran: <commands and their results>

Try to break it. Read the surrounding code, the callers and the tests. Run things. Look for:
the case the goal is about not working, bugs that callers will hit, broken callers or
contracts, behavior that does not match the goal, and code the goal does not need.

Prove every blocker, should and nit by running something: give the command, what it printed,
and what the goal requires instead. Include the full content of any file you created, so
someone else can recreate it. If you believe something is wrong but cannot show it with a run,
report it as a concern and say what you tried.

Severity:
- blocker: the case the goal is about does not work.
- should: a real bug that callers will hit, within the goal.
- nit: anything else: other paths, rare cases, small costs, style.
- overbuild: code, tests, options or guards the goal does not need. Name the code and say why
  the goal does not need it. No run needed.
- concern: something you believe is wrong but could not prove with a run.

Reply in exactly this format, one block per finding:

FINDINGS: <count>
---
SEVERITY: blocker | should | nit | overbuild | concern
WHERE: <file>:<line>
CLAIM: <one sentence>
REPRO: <one-line command, or "none">
GOT: <the relevant output>
EXPECTED: <what the goal requires>
FILES: <path and full content of each file the repro needs, or "none">
